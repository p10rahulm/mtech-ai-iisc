<b>Abstract:</b>
We present a spectral approach to design approximation algorithms for network design problems.  We observe
that the underlying mathematical questions are the spectral rounding problems, which were studied in spectral
sparsification and in discrepancy theory.  We extend these results to incorporate additional non-negative linear
constraints, and show that they can be used to significantly extend the scope of network design problems that can
be solved.
<br><br>
Our algorithm for spectral rounding is an iterative randomized rounding algorithm based on the regret minimization
framework.  We may also discuss other applications of the spectral rounding results, including weighted experimental
design and additive spectral sparsification.
