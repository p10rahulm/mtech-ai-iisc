<b>Abstract:</b>
Consider the setting where vectors in [-1,1]^n  arrive online, and upon the arrival of vector $v_t$ at time t, it must
be immediately and irrevocably assigned a sign +1 or -1. The goal is to pick these signs to ensure that the norm of the
signed sum of these vectors stays small.
<br><br>
Such online discrepancy games were originally considered by Spencer in the 70's, but have received renewed attention
due to applications in online algorithms.  I will give an overview of the results and techniques in the area and
describe several new recent results that obtain close to optimal bounds in many settings.
<br><br>
I will also discuss several basic questions that remain completely open.

Based on joint works with Joel Spencer, Haotian Jiang, Sahil Singla and Makrand Sinha
