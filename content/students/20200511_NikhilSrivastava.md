Hyperbolic Programming is a generalization of SDP obtained by replacing determinants (whose zero free regions
define the PSD cone) by hyperbolic polynomials, whose zero-free regions define hyperbolicity cones. One of the main
questions in real algebraic geometry, called the Generalized Lax Conjecture, is whether this generalization is
strict -- i.e., whether every hyperbolicity cone can be written as a section of a PSD cone of some (potentially larger)
dimension. We study the quantitative version of this question, namely, how large does the dimension of the PSD cone
need to be?

We show that there exist (many) hyperbolicity cones in n dimensions of degree d, such that any semidefinite
representation of them must have dimension roughly exponential in $n^d$, even if approximation is allowed. Our
cones are random perturbations of the cones induced by the elementary symmetric polynomials. Constructing
succinctly describable cones with this property remains an open question. The proof involves robust versions of
several classical facts about real rooted polynomials.
